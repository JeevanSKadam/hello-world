# hello-world

Hi, I'm Jeevan Kadam, a skilled problem-solver, catalyst, and relationship builder. 
Welcome to my profile!

I am just starting with my journey in Data Science. I know Tableau, SQL, Gretl, and Spreadsheet Modeling.
I am currently working in learning R, Python, Data Cleaning & Manipulation, and Exploratory Data Analysis.
The field is new for almost all of us, we can only do our best to learn as much as we can.

If you think that I can be of help to you or if you would like to learn more about me, please get in touch or connect.

I can be contacted directly at jsk377@cornell.edu
